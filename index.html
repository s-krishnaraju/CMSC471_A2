                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>This dataset is from the <a
                                    href="https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/state-transportation-statistics/us-airline-traffic-airport">Bureau
                                    of Transport Statistics</a> and shows the number of passengers
                                that each U.S. airport enplanned (boarded onto a plane) in the year of 2024. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div style="flex: .4;">
                            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                            <p>The main visualizations are a Scatter Map and a Pie Chart. The Scatter Map shows the
                                location of each airport and info about the airport on hover (name, location, and
                                passenger enplanement), as well as having the ability to pan and zoom. The size of the
                                scatter point of each airplane is scaled based on that airport's passenger enplanements
                                and I also added a color scale that utilizes passenger enplanements ( top 10 airports
                                have unique colors while the rest use a color scale based on shades of blue). I felt
                                this was a good design decision since it allows a viewer to see which airports have high
                                passenger enplanements at a glance. The unique colors of the top 10 airports also match
                                up with the Pie Chart which helps link the two visualizations together. Finally, I added
                                a slider which can filter the airports based on passengers enplaned (both Pie Chart and
                                Scatter Map). Since the dataset has a lot of airports that have a neglible amount of
                                enplanements, it helps the viewer filter out the noise. It could also help them draw
                                some additional insights from the data by looking at airports within a specific range of
                                passenger enplanements. </p>

                            <h3>Data Resources</h3>
                            <p>Data was from Bureau of Transport (<a
                                    href="https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/state-transportation-statistics/us-airline-traffic-airport">Source</a>).
                                I took some inspiration from the Bureau of Transport's visualization on the dataset for
                                my Scatter Map but I added additional functionality to the map and linked it with
                                another visualization, a Pie Chart. </p>

                        </div>
                        <div style="flex:.4;">
                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>I did the project solo, so none of the work was split. The development process was pretty
                                straightforward as I already have experience using Plotly in an internship I did. I
                                would say one aspect that was slightly challenging was deciding on how to color the
                                scatter points. I made the map first with the color scale feature and then the pie
                                chart. However I realized I needed to link the two charts together colorwise but I
                                didn't want to get rid of the color scale feature on the map. I ended up striking a
                                middle ground and just giving the top 10 airports on the map the pie chart color and the
                                rest of the airports the color scale. I would say I spent about 3 hours on the project.
                            </p>
